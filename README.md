Software for my printable Evangelion inspired clock.

## Project Background
  For this project I was wanting to build a clock. (Obviosly) When deciding on a theme, I thought about the countdown timer that is rather prominently 
in Neon Genesis Evangelion. The Eva normally uses an external umbilical for power, but can run from internal power for a limited time. When the umbilical 
is disconnected, the timer is activated.
  
  This [timer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrcory/Eva_Clock/main/images/sources/image.png) only has positions for a single minute, 2 seconds, and 
  deci- and centiseconds. This meant I had to extend and shift positions for [normal time telling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrcory/Eva_Clock/main/images/sources/vpHimage.png).
